# Image segmentation for wheats using SOTA Models

## Objectives
   - Develop an image segmentation vision app using SOTA models
   - Evaluate multiple SOTA models: Yolov8-seg, SAM model, U-Net
   - Compare and analyze the performance of each model
   - Use onnxruntime to accelerate inference time

## Download data from Kaggle
The Global Wheat Head Dataset is led by nine research institutes from seven countries: the University of Tokyo, Institute national de recherche pour agriculture, alimentation et environment, Arvalis, ETHZ, University of Saskatchewan, University of Queensland, Nanjing Agricultural University, and Roth Amsted Research. These institutions are joined by many in their pursuit of accurate wheat head detection, including the Global Institute for Food Security, Digi tag, Kubota, and Hyphen.
Train : 3422 images 
Test   : 10 images 

## Image Segmentation
We used CVAT to annotate our image.

In CVAT there are three methods to annotate images: polygon, ai tool, using pre-trained model.
